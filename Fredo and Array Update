problem statement:
Fredo is assigned a new task today. He is given an array A containing N integers. His task is to update all elements of array to some minimum value x , that is,  ;  such that sum of this new array is strictly greater than the sum of the initial array. Note that x should be as minimum as possible such that sum of the new array is greater than the sum of the initial array.

Input Format:
First line of input consists of an integer N denoting the number of elements in the array A.
Second line consists of N space separated integers denoting the array elements.
